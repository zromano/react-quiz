## React-Quiz

This is a simple way to make a quiz in React using TypeScript.

I made this while I was learning React and thought other beginners might find it useful. Feel free to use it as you please!

Useful commands:
* Download Dependencies: `npm install`
* Start (use for hot reloads while deving): `npm start`
* Make a Production Build: `npm run build`
